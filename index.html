                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Chef Normand Laprise is both a cook and a writer but before he followed his passion for cooking his
                    first
                    venture was in the academic field of accounting. His farm life as a child was perhaps the foundation
                    of
                    his likeness for freshly picked vegetables on dinner tables. Now co-owner of internationally
                    acclaimed
                    Toque restaurant, he is a prominent figure in the culinary world respected by his peers.</p>
